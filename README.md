# alignment.js

A suite of reusable [React](http://reactjs.org/) components for creating a variety of visualizations involving [multiple sequence alignments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment). [View the live demo here](http://alignment.hyphy.org/).

`alignment.js` can be used to create standard MSA viewers, utilizing functional programming to permit custom behavior such as highlighting individual sites:

as well as scaffold viewers for next-generation sequencing data where a reference sequence stays fixed to the top:

and joint phylogeny/alignment viewers using packages like [phylotree.js](https://github.com/veg/phylotree.js):
